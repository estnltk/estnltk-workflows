## I. Goal

The goal of this labelling task is to identify:
* which verb-case pairs always or never identify location phrases;
* which verb-case pairs always or never identify time phrases;
* which verb-case pairs always or never identify persons;
* which verb-case pairs always or never identify organisations.

As it is difficult to draw a clear line between these categories, we ask
questions that easier to answer and yield more informative responses.
See the [labelling instructions](./labelling_instructions) for further details.
