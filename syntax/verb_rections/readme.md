# Workflows for extracting information about verb rections

In Estonian the case of a noun determines how exactly the noun is connected to
the verb. Moreover, each verb has one or many connection templates (frames) and
each of then has a specific meaning. In each frame, a verb has fixed set of
arguments it is connected to (e.g. object and subject) and cases are used to
indicate in which role the noun is in the frame.  

Workflows in this directory are built to semi-automatically extract information
about verb frames. We mostly use statistical analysis to tease out revealing
examples which are later manually labelled further.
