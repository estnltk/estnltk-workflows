⚠️ These are legacy workflows, no longer supported.

The demo workflows here are related to EstNLTK PostgreSQL collecions.

There are three main steps:
1. Data import

   Create a new EstNLTK collection and insert data. The texts can be imported from any source.
   Here is an example workflow for importing from a PostgreSQL table.

2. Data processing

   This mainly means creating new layers to the collection.

3. Data expot

   A layer from the collecton can be exported to PostgreSQL table or to TEXTA.
